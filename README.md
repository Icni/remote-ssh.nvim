# remote-ssh-nvim
This plugin is meant to recreate similar behavior to VS Code's Remote SSH plugin by enabling the feel of a local editor while keeping the source code being edited on the remote machine for compilation, execution, etc

## Remote SSH Commands
`:RemoteSSHCreateConfig` will create a file in the current directory used to specify details of the local-remote session you'd like to run
:RemoteSSHStart
:RemoteSSHStop
